However, they are specialized networks in that each of them can handle just one noise level fixed in their respective training process. In this letter, by investigating the distribution invariance of the natural image patches with respect to linear transforms, we show how to make a single existing deep neural network work well across all levels of Gaussian noise, thereby allowing to significantly reduce the training time for a general-purpose neural network powered denoising algorithm.},

The method was applied to calculate left ventricular volume and ejection fraction estimation.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nMETHODS: A fast adaptive B-spline snake algorithm that resolves the computational concerns of conventional active contours and avoids computationally expensive optimizations was developed. A combination of external forces, adaptive node insertion, and multiresolution strategy was incorporated in the proposed algorithm. Boundary extraction with area and volume estimation in left ventricular echocardiographic images was implemented using the B-spline snake algorithm. The method was implemented in MATLAB and 50 medical images were used to evaluate the algorithm performance. Experimental validation was done using a database of echocardiographic images that had been manually evaluated by experts.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nRESULTS: Comparison of methods demonstrates significant improvement over conventional algorithms using the adaptive B-spline technique. Moreover, our method reached a reasonable agreement with the results obtained manually by experts. The accuracy of boundary detection was calculated with Dice's coefficient equation (91.13{\%}), and the average computational time was 1.24 s in a PC implementation.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSION: In sum, the proposed method achieves satisfactory results with low computational complexity. This algorithm provides a robust and feasible technique for echocardiographic image segmentation. Suggestions for future improvements of the method are provided.},

abstract = {In this paper we provide the first, to the best of our knowledge, Bayesian formulation of one of the most successful and well-studied statistical models of shape and texture, i.e. Active Appearance Models (AAMs). To this end, we use a simple probabilistic model for texture generation assuming both Gaussian noise and a Gaussian prior over a latent texture space. We retrieve the shape parameters by formulating a novel cost function obtained by marginalizing out the latent texture space. This results in a fast implementation when compared to other simultaneous algorithms for fitting AAMs, mainly due to the removal of the calculation of texture parameters. We demonstrate that, contrary to what is believed regarding the performance of AAMs in generic fitting scenarios, optimization of the proposed cost function produces results that outperform discriminatively trained state-of-the-art methods in the problem of facial alignment "in the wild".},

abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

abstract = {Cascaded regression has recently become the method of choice for solving non-linear least squares problems such as deformable image alignment. Given a sizeable training set, cascaded regression learns a set of generic rules that are sequentially applied to minimise the least squares prob-lem. Despite the success of cascaded regression for prob-lems such as face alignment and head pose estimation, there are several shortcomings arising in the strategies proposed thus far. Specifically, (a) the regressors are learnt indepen-dently, (b) the descent directions may cancel one another out and (c) handcrafted features (e.g., HoGs, SIFT etc.) are mainly used to drive the cascade, which may be sub-optimal for the task at hand. In this paper, we propose a combined and jointly trained convolutional recurrent neural network architecture that allows the training of an end-to-end to system that attempts to alleviate the aforementioned draw-backs. The recurrent module facilitates the joint optimisa-tion of the regressors by assuming the cascades form a non-linear dynamical system, in effect fully utilising the infor-mation between all cascade levels by introducing a memory unit that shares information across all levels. The convo-lutional module allows the network to extract features that are specialised for the task at hand and are experimentally shown to outperform hand-crafted features. We show that the application of the proposed architecture for the problem of face alignment results in a strong improvement over the current state-of-the-art.},

@inproceedings{Galoogahi2016,
abstract = {The application of correlation filters for the task of facial landmark detection has been studied by many vision works. Their success, however, is limited by the presence of large pose variations, expression and occlusion in face images. Moreover existing correlation filters may suffer from poor discrimination to distinguish visually similar landmarks such as the right and left eyes. In this work, we present a new framework, referred to as Correlation Filter Cascade, to address the above limitations. The proposed framework consists of a set of correlation filters with different spatial supports (sizes) which are connected together in a cascade form. More specifically, the size of filters decreases from the lower to upper levels. Filters at lower levels implicitly code face shape information since they are trained using large patches stemmed from face images. This avoids ambiguous detections caused by landmarks with similar appearance. Detections in these levels, however, may not be accurate and suffer from small localization errors', mainly caused by face pose, expression and occlusion. Therefore, locations detected by lower levels will be further used by the higher levels to narrow down their search, regions. Since the filters at higher levels have smaller size, they are less affected by pose, expression and occlusion, and thus, can perform more accurately. The evaluation on BiolD and LFPW shows the superiority of our method compared to prior correlation filters and leading facial landmark detectors.},
