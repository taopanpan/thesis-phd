abstract = {Stacked sparse denoising autoencoders (SSDAs) have recently been shown to be successful at removing noise from corrupted images. However, like most denoising techniques, the SSDA is not robust to variation in noise types beyond what it has seen during training. To address this limitation, we present the adaptive multi-column stacked sparse denoising autoencoder (AMC-SSDA), a novel technique of combining multiple SSDAs by (1) computing optimal column weights via solving a nonlinear optimization program and (2) training a separate network to predict the optimal weights. We eliminate the need to determine the type of noise, let alone its statistics, at test time and even show that the system can be robust to noise not seen in the training set. We show that state-of-the-art denoising performance can be achieved with a single system on a variety of different noise types. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of AMC-SSDA as a preprocessing (denoising) algorithm by achieving strong classification performance on corrupted MNIST digits.},

abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57{\%} error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28{\%} relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC {\&} COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

abstract = {Model-based vision is firmly established as a robust approach to recognizing and locating known rigid objects in the presence of noise, clutter, and occlusion. It is more problematic to apply model-based methods to images of objects whose appearance can vary, though a number of approaches based on the use of flexible templates have been proposed. The problem with existing methods is that they sacrifice model specificity in order to accommodate variability, thereby compromising robustness during image interpretation. We argue that a model should only be able to deform in ways characteristic of the class of objects it represents. We describe a method for building models by learning patterns of variability from a training set of correctly annotated images. These models can be used for image search in an iterative refinement algorithm analogous to that employed by Active Contour Models (Snakes). The key difference is that our Active Shape Models can only deform to fit the data in ways consistent with the training set. We show several practical examples where we have built such models and used them to locate partially occluded objects in noisy, cluttered images.},

A combination of external forces, adaptive node insertion, and multiresolution strategy was incorporated in the proposed algorithm. Boundary extraction with area and volume estimation in left ventricular echocardiographic images was implemented using the B-spline snake algorithm.

@article{Saragih2011,
abstract = {Deformable model fitting has been actively pursued in the computer vision community for over a decade. As a result, numerous approaches have been proposed with varying degrees of success. A class of approaches that has shown substantial promise is one that makes independent predictions regarding locations of the model's landmarks, which are combined by enforcing a prior over their joint motion. A common theme in innovations to this approach is the replacement of the distribution of probable landmark locations, obtained from each local detector, with simpler parametric forms. In this work, a principled optimization strategy is proposed where nonparametric representations of these likelihoods are maximized within a hierarchy of smoothed estimates. The resulting update equations are reminiscent of mean-shift over the landmarks but with regularization imposed through a global prior over their joint motion. Extensions to handle partial occlusions and reduce computational complexity are also presented. Through numerical experiments, this approach is shown to outperform some common existing methods on the task of generic face fitting.},

abstract = {In this paper we provide the first, to the best of our knowledge, Bayesian formulation of one of the most successful and well-studied statistical models of shape and texture, i.e. Active Appearance Models (AAMs). To this end, we use a simple probabilistic model for texture generation assuming both Gaussian noise and a Gaussian prior over a latent texture space. We retrieve the shape parameters by formulating a novel cost function obtained by marginalizing out the latent texture space. This results in a fast implementation when compared to other simultaneous algorithms for fitting AAMs, mainly due to the removal of the calculation of texture parameters. We demonstrate that, contrary to what is believed regarding the performance of AAMs in generic fitting scenarios, optimization of the proposed cost function produces results that outperform discriminatively trained state-of-the-art methods in the problem of facial alignment "in the wild".},

abstract = {This work presents a novel non-parametric Bayesian formulation for aligning faces in unseen images. Popular ap- proaches, such as the Constrained Local Models (CLM) or the Active Shape Models (ASM), perform facial alignment through a local search, combining an ensemble of detectors with a global optimization strategy that constraints the facial feature points to be within the subspace spanned by a Point Distribution Model (PDM). The global optimization can be posed as a Bayesian inference problem, looking to maximize the posterior distribution of the PDM parameters in a maximum a posteriori (MAP) sense. Previous approaches rely exclusively on Gaussian inference techniques, i.e. both the likelihood (detectors responses) and the prior (PDM) are Gaussians, resulting in a posterior which is also Gaussian, whereas in this work the poste- rior distribution is modeled as being non-parametric by a Kernel Density Estimator (KDE). We show that this posterior distribution can be efficiently inferred using Sequential Monte Carlo methods, in particular using a Regularized Particle Filter (RPF). The technique is evaluated in detail on several standard datasets (IMM, BioID, XM2VTS, LFW and FGNET Talking Face) and compared against state-of- the-art CLM methods. We demonstrate that inferring the PDM parameters non-parametrically significantly increase the face alignment performance.},

abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

abstract = {Cascaded regression has recently become the method of choice for solving non-linear least squares problems such as deformable image alignment. Given a sizeable training set, cascaded regression learns a set of generic rules that are sequentially applied to minimise the least squares prob-lem. Despite the success of cascaded regression for prob-lems such as face alignment and head pose estimation, there are several shortcomings arising in the strategies proposed thus far. Specifically, (a) the regressors are learnt indepen-dently, (b) the descent directions may cancel one another out and (c) handcrafted features (e.g., HoGs, SIFT etc.) are mainly used to drive the cascade, which may be sub-optimal for the task at hand. In this paper, we propose a combined and jointly trained convolutional recurrent neural network architecture that allows the training of an end-to-end to system that attempts to alleviate the aforementioned draw-backs. The recurrent module facilitates the joint optimisa-tion of the regressors by assuming the cascades form a non-linear dynamical system, in effect fully utilising the infor-mation between all cascade levels by introducing a memory unit that shares information across all levels. The convo-lutional module allows the network to extract features that are specialised for the task at hand and are experimentally shown to outperform hand-crafted features. We show that the application of the proposed architecture for the problem of face alignment results in a strong improvement over the current state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {The application of correlation filters for the task of facial landmark detection has been studied by many vision works. Their success, however, is limited by the presence of large pose variations, expression and occlusion in face images. Moreover existing correlation filters may suffer from poor discrimination to distinguish visually similar landmarks such as the right and left eyes. In this work, we present a new framework, referred to as Correlation Filter Cascade, to address the above limitations. The proposed framework consists of a set of correlation filters with different spatial supports (sizes) which are connected together in a cascade form. More specifically, the size of filters decreases from the lower to upper levels. Filters at lower levels implicitly code face shape information since they are trained using large patches stemmed from face images. This avoids ambiguous detections caused by landmarks with similar appearance. Detections in these levels, however, may not be accurate and suffer from small localization errors', mainly caused by face pose, expression and occlusion. Therefore, locations detected by lower levels will be further used by the higher levels to narrow down their search, regions. Since the filters at higher levels have smaller size, they are less affected by pose, expression and occlusion, and thus, can perform more accurately. The evaluation on BiolD and LFPW shows the superiority of our method compared to prior correlation filters and leading facial landmark detectors.},
